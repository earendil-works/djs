## Backlog (not yet written up)

- P1 (split in docs/compiler.md section 10, P1-1..P1-10): functions + closures + the resolution pass, objects/arrays literals, exceptions,
  let/const/TDZ, template literals, destructuring, spread, arrows, classes. The Cheney GC.
- P2: promises, async/await, job queue, async host calls, djs-bgen (checker + JS emitter),
  builtins in the builtin language, base snapshot, JSON, core builtins, djs-wasm, JS host
  package.
- P3: TypeScript type skipper (+ the `strip-types` oracle vs ts-blank-space), enums,
  namespaces, parameter properties.
- P4: snapshot/restore API, deltas, old generation.
- P5: regex engine, generators, Map/Set/WeakMap, Symbol, iterators, typed arrays, …
- Perf track: the bgen Rust backend, benchmarks.

## Parallelism notes

0002, 0003, 0004 and 0005 touch disjoint areas (the only shared file is
`djs-core/src/lib.rs`, mod lines only, which rebases trivially), and none depends on
another. So they run in parallel.
